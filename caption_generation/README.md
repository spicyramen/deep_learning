# Deep Learning Caption Generation Model in Keras

Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem 
where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content 
of the image and a language model from the field of natural language 
processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the 
right order.
